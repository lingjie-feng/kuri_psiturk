debugCVRSr:debug6ifxb,comment,"I wish the sliders had numbered increments because I feel like I was not consistent with my ratings throughout the entire survey. I also thought most of the behavior was mild because the robot's design is inherently cute. I would have found definitions of the criteria (positive, negative, mild, intense, etc,) helpful."
